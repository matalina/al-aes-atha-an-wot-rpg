                <p>'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long  ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't  be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a  very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and&mdash;oh dear, how puzzling  it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me  see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and  four times seven is&mdash;oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and  Rome&mdash;no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little&mdash;"' and she crossed her  hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,  but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the  same as they used to do:&mdash;</p>

                <p>'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes  filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and  I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to  no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've  made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no  use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I  shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,  if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here  till I'm somebody else"&mdash;but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst  of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired  of being all alone here!'</p>

                <p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while  she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must  be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure  herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now  about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found  out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped  it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>

                <p>'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the  sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and  now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was  lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'  thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'</p>

                <p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!  she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she  had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by  railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in  her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go  to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the  sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row  of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon  made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she  was nine feet high.</p>

                <p>'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying  to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by  being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'</p>
